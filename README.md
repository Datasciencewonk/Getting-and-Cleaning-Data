# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
Footnote: I fully understand why data scientists spend most of their time retrieving and "cleaning" data. 

The information is the same as my run-analysis in describing what each code does in R.
Thank you!
